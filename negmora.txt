
“Wine and women make wise men dote and forsake God's law and do wrong." 

However, the fault is not in the wine, and often not in the woman.
 The fault is in the one who misuses the wine or the woman or other of God's crations.
 Even if you get drunk on the wine and through this greed you lapse into lechery, 
the wine is not to blame but you are, in being unable or unwilling to discipline yourself. 
And even if you look at a woman and become caught up in her beauty and assent to sin [= adultery; extramarital sex], 
the woman is not to blame nor is the beauty given her by God to be disparaged: rather, 
you are to blame for not keeping your heart more clear of wicked thoughts. ... If you feel yourself tempted by the sight of a woman, control your gaze better ...
 You are free to leave her. Nothing constrains you to commit lechery but your own lecherous heart.” 
Typically, "moral stories" end in a way so that the positive behaviour (good action) is somehow reinforced, 
whereas the negative action leads to some form of negative consequences; juridically to punishment, 
socially to criticism and reprimand and morally to contempt.
